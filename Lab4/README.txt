3. Any additional information you would like to let us know about.
Our 3 program files (program1.py, program2.py, program3.py) were written in Python originally, so that we could easily
test the logic. We then use a compiler written in Python (compile.py) to compile our 3 program files into our assembly
language, and generate the lookup table for immediate values (LUT_Imm.sv). Afterward, an assembler written in Python
(assemble.py) is used to assemble the assembly files into machine code and generate the lookup table for address values
(LUT_Add.sv).


4. If you have already done your demo with Professor Eldon before you make this Gradescope submission, mention it in
   your README.
We haven't already done our demo.
